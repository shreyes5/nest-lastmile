Simulation: 
Logging service will be the one that will log the ride and fetch the coordinates of the rider. We can log coordinates of a rider in the db every n number of minutes.
Getting information about a rider will be done via TCP request to the rider service.

Rider service will be one where riders can login/signup/etc. Anything related to a ride will be implemented in this service.
